# Weather App

Simple weather app using OpenWeaterMap API to return the current temp along with the 5 day forecast and high temperatures.

### To-Do:

- Add a (good-looking) loading indicator after each search
- Add a Farenheit to Celsius switch
- Have a dynamic background that changes with the weather and time of day
- Set the icon to a moon instead of a sun if it's clear at night

A lot of these 'to-dos' I don't plan on doing. This project was done to be async and API practice for me, and it achieved that. Implementing this other stuff would be trivial and feels to me like a waste of time.
